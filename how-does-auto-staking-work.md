How Does Auto-Staking Work?

The CAP Auto-Stake feature is a simple yet cutting-edge function called **Buy-Hold-Earn**, that provides the ultimate ease of use for $C24 holders.

**Buy-Hold-Earn** - By simply buying and holding $C24 token in your wallet, you earn rebase rewards as interest payments directly into your wallet. Your tokens will increase **every 10 minutes**.

Using a Positive Rebase formula, **Clock24** makes it possible for token distribution to be paid directly proportional to the epoch rebase rewards, worth 0.018% every 10 minute epoch period of the total amount of **$C24** tokens held in your wallet. The rebase rewards are distributed on each EPOCH (10 minute rebase period) to all **$C24** holders.

**This means that without moving their tokens from their wallet, Clock 24 holders receive an annual compound interest of** 1,284,615.72**% for Year 1.**

**The interest rebase rate then reduces after the first 12 months: Click**
