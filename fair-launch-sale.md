# Fair Launch Sale

_**The Fair Launch PinkSale link will be March 26th, 13:00 UTC Time.**_

**THIS IS THE OFFICIAL PINKSALE LINK:**

We will follow a **Fair Launch** and comply to Fair Launch Rules where everyone will be able to acquire **$C24** tokens in an equal way on the [**PinkSale platform**](https://www.pinksale.finance/#/launchpad/0x5fe7492fc04092E610919E0301c2f0134cB9b284?chain=BSC) using BNB.

**Whitelist -** There is no whitelisting required. Everybody will have an equal chance to buy $C24 on PinkSale at release time. First come, first serve. One good new for our participants is that there is no hardcap, however once our soft cap is reached, there will be no further available investment at the fair Launch rate. The only way to buy $C24 will be on PankcakeSwap upon public market release via the $C24/BNB pair.

**PancakeSwap Listing -** After initial fair Launch funding has completed we will go to market by creating the $C24/BNB liquidity pair within 24 hours.

Pre-Launch funds will be used to create the PancakeSwap $C24/BNB liquidity pair. This liquidity will be **locked for 75 years** via trusted [**PinkLock**](https://www.pinksale.finance/#/launchpad/0x5fe7492fc04092E610919E0301c2f0134cB9b284?chain=BSC).
