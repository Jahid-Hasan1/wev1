# The Beauty of Mathematics

Let's assume our Fair Launch on [PinkSale](https://www.pinksale.finance/#/launchpad/0x5fe7492fc04092E610919E0301c2f0134cB9b284?chain=BSC) goes smoothly and our Hard Cap is reached with the starting supply of 537,517.643 C24 tokens. With the effect of exponential compounding at the end of year (365 days); the Market Cap will go from $3,000,000 (3 Million) to $18,668,588,820! (18.6 Billion).

That is true, assuming the token price stays the same at initial market rate only. If we see high market demand from a lot of buyers, we could well see the market cap be a lot higher at EOY.

Nevertheless the math gives us an extremely high probability of $C24 being in the Top 10.
