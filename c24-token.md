# C24 Token

$C24 is a Bep20 token with Asset Multiplication Protocol in every 10 minutes over the lifespan of 24 years until the maximum supply of 3.24 Billion tokens has been reached.

**Is C24 just another Titano Fork?**

The entire protocol's smart contract is written and developed from scratch by our own competent team of developers. It does not contain any resemblance to Titano's code or operation as Clock24 follows a completely new and different set of mechanics which allows for complete protocol sustainability.

We also have several proprietary mechanisms in place that we have created ourselves which offers many improvements over our competition such as; our C24 Auto-Liquidity Engine (CALE), the C24 Insurance Fund (CIF), our Longterm Interest Clock (LIC), aswell as safeguards in place which secure against malicious hack attempts.

Clock 24's tokenomics are also completely unique with our Auto-Burn burning Pit structure, minimal starting supply and lower 10 minute Epoch's for a much more linear APY progression of attainability.
