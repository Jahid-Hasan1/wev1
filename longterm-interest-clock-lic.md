Longterm Interest Clock (LIC)

In order to maintain sustainability and future growth, we have introduced a Longterm Interest Clock (LIC) component which will award $C24 token holders with continued compound interest in perpetuity.

Each Interest Clock is 10 minutes in length and is referred to as an **EPOCH**.

There are 52,560 EPOCH's in 1 year.
