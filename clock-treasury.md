# Clock Treasury

The Treasury is very important in the C24 CAP protocol. It performs three critical functions for the growth and long-term viability of CX24.io. The treasury serves as an additional source of funding for the CIF. This additional support could be useful if the $C24 token's price falls dramatically. It contributes to the establishment of a floor price for the $C24 token.
