# Clock24 Buy and Sell Fees

**C24 buy and sell fees are an important component of the CAP**. They provide capital for performing critical functions to the protocol.

Other protocols like ours use selling bonds to support the same functions as Clock 24 fees, however we strongly believe that approach is riskier because of the risk of no sale of bonds, the token can lose its support and spiral downward in price as we have seen with several of these bond based protocols.

In addition to that, selling bonds also costs token holders. It reduces the amount of APY that can be offered and eliminates the ability to offer a stable APY.

The amount of the fees (**6% for buys** and **8% for sells**) allows Clock 24 to provide $C24 holders with the stable high yield of 12,846,15.72% annually.
