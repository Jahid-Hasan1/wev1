The first protocol for comparison is Safuu, which uses is CAP protocol for auto-compounding model. Following factors draws a line between Cx24 and Safuu.

**Safuu** offers a staking reward every 15 minutes, whereas Cx24 has reduced this time to reward distribution, every 10 minutes.

Safuu offers return 96 time a day, and Cx24 offers return 144 times a day, thus offering a drastically higher return rate than the former.

**Safuu** offers a fixed APY of 122,234%, while Cx24 offers a fixed APY of 12,846,15.72%

The second protocol is Titano. Itâ€™s comparison with Cx24 leads out following results:

**Titano** offers a fixed APY of 102,483.52%, whereas Cx24 offers a fixed APY of 12,846,15.72%

**Titano** propose a daily rate on investment of 1.8666%. On the contrary, Cx24 offer a daily compounding of 144 times.

Hence, all of these aforementioned propositions supports Cx24 supremacy over its counter protocols.
