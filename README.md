**CX24.io rebase tokenomics** To support its price and rebase rewards, the CX24.io employs a complex set of factors. It includes the $C24 Clock Insurance Fund (CIF), which acts as an insurance fund to ensure the C24 Protocol's price stability and long-term viability by maintaining a consistent 0.018 percent rebase rate paid to all $C24 token holders every 10 minutes.

**Staking - Easy and Safe** The C24 tokens always stay in your wallet; it doesn't need to be put into the high risk staking contract. All you need to do is buy & hold it and automatically multiply rewards in your own wallet so there’s no need to learn about the stake/unstake mechanism and also avoid paying an additional tax fee on staking operations.

**CX24.io insurance fund** The $C24 Insurance Fund, abbreviated CIF, is a separate wallet in C24's CAP system. The CIF employs an algorithm that underpins the Rebase Rewards and is funded by a portion of the buy and sell trading fees accumulated in the CIF wallet. Simply put, the CIF parameter backs the staking rewards (rebase rewards) that are distributed every 10 minutes at a rate of 0.018 percent, ensuring a high and stable interest rate to $C24 token holders.

**Reduction of risk associated with downside** Ensuring long term growth continuity by maintaining constant growth levels Ensuring price stability through rebase strategy

**C24 Treasury** The Treasury is very important in the C24 CAP protocol. It performs three critical functions for the growth and long-term viability of CX24.io. The treasury serves as an additional source of funding for the CIF. This additional support could be useful if the $C24 token's price falls dramatically. It contributes to the establishment of a floor price for the $C24 token.

**The Burning Pit** The burning Pit consumes 1.0 percent of all $C24 traded. The more that is traded, the more that is added to the fire, causing the fire pit to grow in size, larger and larger through self-fulfilling Auto-Compounding, reducing the circulating supply and maintaining the C24 protocol stable.

**Liquidity management** Liquidity can be thought of as a large pool of money that is split into half between $C24 and $BNB tokens. There is a conversion ratio that is set to the amount of $C24 that can be obtained through BNB, for example: 1 BNB equals 36.44 C24.

**APY formulation for C24** The CX24.io protocol follows daily-interest compounding simple formulation Where. A is the future value of your investment P is the principle investment r is the interest rate in decimals n is the number of time interest compounded in the given time t is the total time period for investment maturity It should be noted that rate r and time t should be expressed in the same time units, such as months or years. Time conversions based on a 365-day year have 30.4167 days/month and 91.2501 days/quarter. There are 360 days in a year, with 30 days per month and 90 days per quarter. In the present case: If the user invests $1000 worth $C24 for a period of 1 year at 0.018% compounding every 10 minutes. He will have $1,284,615.72 C24 after his investment maturity.
